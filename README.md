# Build a Rails API

Rails is really great for building quick APIs out of the box. In this drill, we'll be implementing a couple of standards and GraphQL.

## Instructions:
CompanyAPI is the new hotness in Silicon Valley. The founders of the company Mike & Jim have a great idea to disrupt LinkedIn by creating a free REST JSON Api that stores important data provided by companies throughout the country. The founders don't know how to code and have no money but fortunately they have you to do all of the work. 

- setup ruby & rails (>5)
- run `bundle install`
- run `rake db:setup` 
- inspect the schema
- implement a standard
- convert your standard to graphql

## Note from the Founders
```
  Hey would you mind adding the address to the companies? Customers are upset that they can't find out where any of the companies are located or even who works there.
