# Build a Rails API

Rails is really great for building quick APIs out of the box. In this drill, we'll be implementing a couple of standards and GraphQL.

## Instructions:
CompanyAPI is the new hotness in Silicon Valley. The founders of the company have a great idea to disrupt LinkedIn by creating a free REST JSON Api that stores arbitrary company data. The founders don't know how to code and have no money but fortunately they have you to do all of the work. 

- setup ruby & rails (>5)
- run `bundle install`
- run `rake db:setup` 
- inspect the schema
- implement a standard
- convert your standard to graphql

## Extra Credit
- what are some best practices for building api's?
- implement a few key things missing in this api
